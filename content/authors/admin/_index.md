I have recently recieved my Master of Arts degree in political science, from the [Harry S Truman School of Government & Public Affairs](https://truman.missouri.edu) at the University of Missouri. I am a proud member of [Comanche Nation.](https://comanchenation.com/) My research interests center around American public opinion, NASA and the space industry, bureaucracy, marginalized groups in the United States, and qualitative methods. I also have an interest in representation and diversity within the space industry.
