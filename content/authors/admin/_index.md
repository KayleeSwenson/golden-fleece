I am a political science PhD candidate at the [Harry S Truman School of Government & Public Affairs](https://truman.missouri.edu) at the University of Missouri. My research interests center around American public opinion, NASA and the space industry, public-private partnerships, accountability, administrative politics, bureaucracy, and qualitative methods. I also have an interest in representation and diversity within the space industry.

My current plan for my dissertation centers around perceptions of accountability. Focusing on the public-private partnerships between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the private space industry (such as SpaceX and Blue Origin), my dissertation will analyze this relationship from three different perspectives: the opinions of the American public, government officials, and the private space industry.
